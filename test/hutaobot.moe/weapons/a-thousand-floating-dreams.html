<p>At the moment the palace crumbled, the girl who had never known &quot;light&quot; heard her whisper inside a dream.</p>
<p>Through a mist of tears, the child who had long decided to depart in dreams caught sight of her gentle benevolence.</p>
<p>In the reflection of the serene moonlight, the verdant lamp told of the silhouette of the stars and an everlasting melodyâ€”</p>
<p>A dancer with emerald eyes planting light kisses onto silk dripping with nectar, brightly colored fish pirouetting in pearly clear waters,</p>
<p>A moonlight musician guiding the Jinn&#x27;s torches, singing songs of the gilded fortress in a sea of sand and pomegranate-colored strings,</p>
<p>An astute sailor setting off on a grand voyage, seeking nothing else but the singing voice from a dream and the blooming gardens on the far shore.</p>
<p>The fallen palace illuminated by silent light, encircled by breathtaking dreamscapes from a thousand worlds,</p>
<p>The soft forest breeze clearing away the dust gathered on the homeward path, guiding lost children away from the palace, no longer tranquil as it had been.</p>
<p>As the dawning light filtered through fragmented spaces between leaves, that verdant lamp which had told stories of a thousand nights&#x27; dreams began to fade:</p>
<p>It was only when she looked back, standing between dreams and reality, that the blind girl realized that there was no return, for dawn had broken.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the lamp inside the dream never flickered again, and the flow of time swallowed up the dreams of bygone nights,</p>
<p>But the birds still sang as they embraced the break of dawn. They sang of the stories that blossomed brilliantly like a field of flowers,</p>
<p>Bringing courage, hope, and happiness to the children who had never had the chance to witness a dream,</p>
<p>Weaving a never-ending song of a thousand nights, lighting up the moments before the long-awaited daybreak.</p>
<p>After traversing a thousand dreams, until the nightingale no longer sang, until the fading sun fell beneath the horizon once again,</p>
<p>The traveler saw at journey&#x27;s end that verdant lamp, that faraway homeland of old,</p>
<p>Where the dew-covered rose still swayed softly in the moonlit breeze, waiting for her to tell a new story:</p>
<p>&quot;Though the memories of past nights have all but faded, we shall continue to sing songs of praise for the sweet dreams that have yet to unfold.&quot;</p></blockquote></div></main></div></div><footer class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center w-full border-t text-center" style="margin-bottom:3px"><div class="flex items-center justify-center">Â© All rights reserved by miHoYo.
