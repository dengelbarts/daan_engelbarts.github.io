<p>&quot;The breeze from afar tugs at my heart,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It sings of my longing for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Long ago, there was a knight who was ever dour of countenance.</p>
<p>Only a certain song could ever cause his brow to unfurl,</p>
<p>And only a certain girl who sang that song in the square,</p>
<p>Could cause him to forget the great burden of his duty for a time.</p>

<p>The Knight and his knights also fought for their land.</p>
<p>When the venomous dragon fell to ruin on the ice-sealed peak, the blue sky dragon fell asleep in the ancient tower.</p>

<p>&quot;She is abroad studying, so she should be well. But ah, how I wish to hear her sing again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At least Arundolyn and Roland are alright. When she returns, this calamity should have blown over.&quot;</p>

<p>The song the girl loved to sing, too, changed upon her return.</p>
<p>&quot;The dandelions carry in the summer wind,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Autumn brings the fragrance of grain.&quot;</p>
