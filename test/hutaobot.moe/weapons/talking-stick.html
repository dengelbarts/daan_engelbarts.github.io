<p>He blew his bronze horn, and raised his colossal obsidian club to his shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;The crisis emerges, yet the tribal leaders bicker endlessly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let Tenoch bring his &#x27;talking stick&#x27; over, and let it mediate the discussion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tenoch belongs no longer to any tribe, yet his fury still burns, unquenched.&quot;</p>
<p>And thus did lonely Tenoch go forth, his colossal obsidian club resting on his shoulder,</p>
<p>Traversing the rugged wilds where dragons roamed, that wilderness of hot springs and lava.</p>
<p>The first to come forward and receive the hero Tenoch was the great runner Wanjiru and her raucous companion, Kayeke.</p>
<p>Her dark skin showed traces of her journey with the hero, the deep scars still visible.</p>
<p>Though the constant infighting among the major tribes was exhausting, Tenoch&#x27;s invitation had reignited her vigor.</p>
<p>A ferocious battle for the burning lands of Natlan loomed â€” what reason did Wanjiru and her tribespeople have to refuse?</p>
<p>The second to step forward and embrace Tenoch was the brave Menilek and his faithful companion Ngoubou.</p>
<p>&quot;Come, come! Though every tribe has chased you from their sight, though we are always at odds,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But in my eyes, you, club-carrying Tenoch, are a hero among heroes, a brother amongst brothers!&quot;</p>
<p>The third to be found by the hero Tenoch was the cunning Sanhaj Kompore and his enigmatic companion Mahamba.</p>
<p>Sanhaj had been persuaded by the &quot;talking stick&quot; before, and the hero agreed to give him the spoils before he agreed to join the fellowship of warriors.</p>
<p>Kompore had foreseen his and Tenoch&#x27;s heroic end, and how the place that would become known as the &quot;Mare Jivari&quot; in later days would be born.</p>
<p>&quot;But nay, it matters little, it matters not! Perhaps there may come a day when the scoundrel made famous for being clever as a viper shall become a hero.&quot;</p>
<p>The fourth willingly volunteered to join the hero Tenoch. This was young Burkina and his reckless companion, Kongamato.</p>
<p>Burkina had never experienced the hardships of battle with Tenoch, but the imposing obsidian club guided him towards the perilous journey.</p>
<p>War had left countless scars upon Tenoch&#x27;s body, and for Burkina, these were the proof of the path that he too must tread...</p>
<p>Revolution should be the fate of the young, to bleed for burning justice, rather than rotting on a comfortable bed of grass.</p>
<p>The fifth to be persuaded by the hero Tenoch was Sundjatta, chief of the mines, and his steady companion Muhuru.</p>
<p>&quot;For the stability of all the tribes, and to avoid further conflict, I once petitioned the Pyro Archon to vote for your expulsion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But even today, you have yet to give up on bloody battle... It just as well, then, that this may be the final battle of our generation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you are so determined to go, then I have no reason not to accompany you, but do not involve my tribe.&quot;</p>
<p>The sixth to go with the hero Tenoch was his greatest foe in his youth, the giant Tupac. No mount could possibly support his massive body.</p>
<p>When Tenoch carried his huge club to Tupac&#x27;s dwelling to speak with him, he found him carefully counting the multitude of scars left on his body by challengers.</p>
<p>&quot;Over 300 scars, twenty broken bones, and over 100 shards of obsidian buried deep within my flesh, like tiny jewels.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Two hundred minor wounds, two broken ribs, and one eye that will never again perceive distance. The trophies you left me are equally generous.&quot;</p>
<p>The two former enemies burst into riotous laughter, and they joined hands.</p>
<p>And thus, Tenoch found allies from each of the six major tribes.</p>
<p>Glittering like the flames of roaring wildfire, they crashed into the mountains of darkness...</p></blockquote></div></main></div></div><footer class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center w-full border-t text-center" style="margin-bottom:3px"><div class="flex items-center justify-center">Â© All rights reserved by miHoYo.
