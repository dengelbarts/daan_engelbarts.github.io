<p>&quot;Never forget the shackles of sin that were once tempting as honey,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And never forget our heavy responsibilities that may now seem like fetters.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They represent the deity&#x27;s honey-sweet grace and faith in us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are the shield that guards against the disaster of the flood, and the line of defense against the breach.&quot;</p>
<p>The first watcher always led the new recruits to recite their oath.</p>
<p>Indeed, no one would wish for such a life, but everything comes with a price.</p>
<p>We once succumbed to the euphoria of violence, or were driven by greed.</p>
<p>This vow is the recompense of justice, as well as the final chance at redemption.</p>
<p>Neither sunlight nor family are present here, so we must find a semblance of joy.</p>
<p>Although the watcher sometimes wondered if the sinners took these vows on their own accord,</p>
<p>Or merely uttered syllables that meant nothing to them,</p>
<p>He still sincerely hoped that the wild joy he experienced when the deity entrusted this heavy responsibility to him,</p>
<p>Would light up the path of these &quot;brothers and sisters&quot; of his, and give meaning to their lives,</p>
<p>Just as it had lit up his hopeless and dreary future.</p>
<p>The teachings of the watchers would thus be passed from generation to generation, flowing down like an endless stream.</p>
<p>For if the harbinger of the apocalypse would indeed one day arrive, the flood would wash everything away.</p>
<p>The watchers would fight with both duty and joy in their our hearts, just as the goddess had found empathy for them in hers.</p>
<p>My duty is now complete, so I shall leave the goddess&#x27; grace and duty to you all.</p>
<p>The first watcher was buried between mineral veins of extraordinary splendor,</p>
<p>Because it is the place most filled with light. The man who had lived for many years in the shadows</p>
<p>Held the light he once saw in his heart as he quietly slumbered beneath the soil by the breach.</p>
<p>The flood that would wash everything away is never unleashed,</p>
<p>As fate is often loath to grant would-be heroes an honorable death.</p>
<p>Even so, an inaudible trickle began to silently corrode the priory as if a thief shrouded in the shadows.</p>
<p>Those forced to join the order and live underwater gradually increased in number,</p>
<p>Yet those who swore the oath, understood its meaning, and knew the teachings only declined over time.</p>
<p>Many long years later, a grand and ominous fortress would rise from the seabed,</p>
<p>But as for the last brother who called himself a watcher and shouldered the expectations of a god,</p>
<p>The location of his grave would become known to none.</p>
<p>Still, perhaps this place can still be called fortunate,</p>
<p>As the other suppressed breach was eventually discovered many years later by one who set out to reveal its secrets.</p></blockquote></div></main></div></div><footer class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center w-full border-t text-center" style="margin-bottom:3px"><div class="flex items-center justify-center">Â© All rights reserved by miHoYo.
